# ICU eActivities API

A PHP API for Imperial College Union's [eActivities](https://eactivities.union.ic.ac.uk).

## Install
Place the [icu_ea_api.php](https://github.com/JCGrant/icu-ea-php-api/blob/master/icu_ea_api.php) file in your project.

## Example
To run the example, download the [example](https://github.com/JCGrant/icu-ea-php-api/tree/master/example) folder and run the following command:

    CSP_CODE=code API_KEY=key YEAR=year php -S localhost:8080

Replace `code`, `key`, and `year` with your own values.

If you gave the correct values, you should see a table of the society's members.
